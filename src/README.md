# CoursePlannerProto

In order to encourage students to take an active role in their course preparation, we have developed an interactive online e-advising application called Course Planner. As a result, students receive a visual representation of their current academic standing and future course through a more effective and engaging experience. The goal is to help students get their degrees more quickly and efficiently while also giving the department data on course demand for enrollment planning.
